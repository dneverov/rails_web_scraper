## How To Continue

### Bootstrap 3.4.1

In `Gemfile` (should be already in; FYI)

```
gem 'bootstrap-sass', '~> 3.4', '>= 3.4.1'
```

Use Yarn. In the project root:

```
yarn add bootstrap@3.4.1 jquery popper.js
```

Pay attention to:
- [config/webpack/environment.js](config/webpack/environment.js)
- [app/javascript/packs/application.js](app/javascript/packs/application.js)

> ### Further Steps

> Though the application so far works fine to scrape from a single page, there are still many things we can implement to make it more promising. Some things to consider:

>    1. Write tests and refactor, beautify with css/bootstrap and implement pagination.
>    2. Implement multi-page scraping eg. pagination, infinite scroll or crawling sub-links. _Hint â€” Check Kimurai github page for more examples_.
>    3. Move the scraping task to background job using Active Job and Sidekiq.
>    4. Kimurai supports several advanced features so go through its documentation.
