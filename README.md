> ### Further Steps

> Though the application so far works fine to scrape from a single page, there are still many things we can implement to make it more promising. Some things to consider:

>    1. Write tests and refactor, beautify with css/bootstrap and implement pagination.
>    2. Implement multi-page scraping eg. pagination, infinite scroll or crawling sub-links. _Hint â€” Check Kimurai github page for more examples_.
>    3. Move the scraping task to background job using Active Job and Sidekiq.
>    4. Kimurai supports several advanced features so go through its documentation.
